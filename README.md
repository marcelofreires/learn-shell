# Learn shell

This repository has been created to study shell based on a tutorial from [learnshell.org](https://www.learnshell.org/en/).

## Annotations

You can see the annotations in a board on my [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/shell-UTK3W7eaUPqGEmPtTWUQoC).

> My annotations have been written in my native language, Portuguese. But you can see the source content by link each topic.

## To run each file

Just run the following command on your terminal:

```shell
bash [file_name.sh]
