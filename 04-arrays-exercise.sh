# =====================================================
# Exercise
#
# In this exercise, you will need to add numbers and
# strings to the correct arrays. You must add the
# numbers 1, 2, and 3 to the "numbers" array, and the
# words 'hello' and 'world' to the strings array.
#
# You will also have to correct the values of the
# variable NumberOfNames and the variable second_name.
# NumberOfNames should hold the total number of names
# in the NAMES array, using the $# special variable.
# Variable second_name should hold the second name in
# the NAMES array, using the brackets operator [ ]. Note
# that the index is zero-based, so if you want to access
# the second item in the list, its index will be 1.
# =====================================================
